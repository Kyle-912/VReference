What issues your team planned to address:

Getting organized and starting the project

Diana: Creating a very basic mockup for the website

Which ones were successfully completed:

None

Diana: The mock-up of the website shows a rudimentary design of how different headsets could be presented to the user of the website,
currently with a placeholder picture for each set shown, so far, as well as a column on the left side intended to filter headsets.

Which ones didn't and why:

All, I was unable to make contact with my team

Diana: Yes, unfortunately we were not able to collaborate in time for the deadline. In hindsight, this was due to a lack of 
clear communication on all of our parts at the start for expectations on what we wanted to do with the project, or
how the application was to be constructed.
Moving forward, we should set up a time and method (such as zoom) to discuss how to prevent this situation from happening again,
how to organize the web app to make it easier for all team members to work on it, and get more familiar with using Git.
